The dedicated Mathematics staff at the school provide challenging work that reflects the high standards that our children achieve in Mathematics.\nThe National Numeracy Strategy\nBreaside Preparatory School is guided by the National Numeracy Strategy (NNS) to a large degree. A high priority is placed upon the development of basic skills at Breaside. We devote at least five hours of teaching time per week to the development of mathematical skills and understanding.\nThe NNS defines numeracy and the characteristics of the “numerate pupil” on p.4, Section 1. We accept those definitions and share the view expounded in the NNS of the factors that pronounce high standards in numeracy (pp.4-5)\nBreaside has naturally developed its own approach to the teaching of Mathematics and we have thus selected the resources that we feel are best suited to our purpose, taking into account particular local conditions which might influence the organisation and pace of our curriculum.\nThe NNS is an extremely detailed and practical document. The broad framework is helpful in ensuring the balanced coverage of the Attainment Targets for Mathematics at Breaside – Number, Shape, Space and Measures: Handling Data.\nIt is important to understand that no separate programme of study is defined for ssing and applying Mathematics, as it should pervade each of the three Attainment Targets.\nThe Breaside Mathematics Curriculum achieves all of the requirements of the NNS and indeeds goes further – it comprehensively ensures that all pupils experience and develop an ability to apply their aquired skills and knowledge appropriately to a variety of mathematical situations.\nBreaside serves the needs of a particular community and as such has its own approach to teaching and learning. We are however guided and informed in our approach by the ‘Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage’, by the National Curriculum orders for Key Stage 1 and 2 and by the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. We enter our pupils for National Curriculum Key Stage 2 SATs and Key Stage 1 SATs therefore, we ensure thorough coverage of the knowledge, skills and understanding required for those tests.\nA broad range of ability is evident amongst our pupils at Breaside. There will be those pupils for whom the agreed expectations will be a considerable challenge, others whose achievements will take them beyond the general expectation. Where it is approriate, work will be planned to differentiate (by task or by outcome) between pupils of varied ability. At Breaside, differentiation is also planned through ‘grouping’ or ‘setting’ strategies.\nAims – Breaside Mathematics \nThe Aims of our department include:\nRecognition and understanding of the ways in which children acquire mathematical understanding.\nFacilitation of the pupil’s Mathematical skills acquisition so that they are able to engage in practical activities, explorations and discussions to develop an understanding, knowledge of and love for Mathematics.\nCoherence and continuity – to ensure that at each successive stage, skills and knowledge are consolidated and built upon.\nMathematics should be fun. Mathematics is a creative discipline and should be used to ‘..understand and change the world’ (NNS)\nWe must help pupils (at particular stages) to develop appropriate examination ‘techniques’ and must provide opportunities for the practice of those techniques.\nIn summary our aim is to provide children with a comprehensive range of mental and written strategies, with mathematical understanding and with the ability to recognise, with confidence, the mathematics that must be applied to the solution of a variety of problems – a fusion of the mechanical and the creative.\nMore detailed information is available about each individual year group by clicking on the following links:\nYear 3\nNational Curriculum guidelines for the teaching of Mathematics are followed, using the Heinemann Maths Scheme Level 4 and a wealth of independent resources.

We have an interactive whiteboard, a dedicated set of i-pads and access to numerous and varied IT resources to support the teaching of science topics. We are keen to develop inquisitive minds and pupil’s practical skills and take an investigative approach to science topics wherever possible.\nScience lessons also take place in outdoor areas within the school grounds and a number of student led projects take place throughout the year.\nAims \nOur main aims in teaching science at Breaside are: \nTo help the children to understand the world about them by learning about a wide range of living things, materials and physical phenomena.\nTo show the children that Science is relevant to them and their everyday lives.\nTo encourage the children to use and apply their scientific knowledge and their own ideas to explain events occurring around them.\nTo develop their methods of scientific enquiry. Investigative work encourages teamwork, co-operation, communication skills, and originality of thought.\nFinally, we hope to stimulate pupils’ curiosity and sense of wonder when they explore the natural and the physical world.\nThe teaching of science\nWe follow the programmes of study for Key Stage 2 set out in the New National Curriculum Science.\nScience is taught through a series of individual topics and is underpinned by knowledge and skills gained through working scientifically. \nWorking Scientifically in Years 3 and 4\nThroughout Years 3 and 4 pupils will be given a wide variety of opportunities for working scientifically. They will ask their own questions about the world around them and will start to decide how they can set up scientific enquiries to answer them. They will be given opportunities to group, sort, and classify items developing communication and justification skills. Pupils will start to look for patterns and will decide on the type of data that is needed to identify these. They will begin to make their own decisions on what observations to make, their frequency and what type of equipment is needed. Pupils will be gaining independence in measuring and recording their data and will be guided into drawing simple conclusions. They will also start to decide if results may be erroneous, and what steps could be taken to improve an investigation. The learning, spelling and appropriate use of scientific vocabulary will develop throughout the whole of Key Stage 2.\nYear 3 Topics\nLight and shadows\nKeeping Healthy – diet, bones, muscles and movement\nRocks, soils and fossils\nForces and magnets\nPlants\nOutdoor studies – observation of changes to plants throughout the seasons\nYear 4 Topics\nSound\nDigestion, teeth and food chains\nHuman Impact on the environment\nSolids, liquids, gases and changes of state\nElectricity\nIntroduction to classification\nWorking Scientifically in Years 5 and 6\nDuring the upper Key Stage 2 years, pupils will further develop existing working scientifically skills. They will become more systematic in asking questions and analysing relationships and will become confident in planning appropriate investigations to answer specific scientific questions. Pupils will make their own decisions concerning frequency, duration and equipment for measurements, and will decide how to record data so that they can look for evidence that supports or refutes their ideas. Our aim is for all pupils to be able to draw conclusions based on their data and observations, use evidence to justify their ideas and use their scientific knowledge and understanding to explain their findings. Relevant scientific language and illustrations are used to discuss, communicate and justify pupil’s scientific ideas, and we discuss how scientific ideas have developed and changed over time.\nYear 5 Topics\nLife cycles\nReproduction in plants and animals\nForces\nEarth and space\nProperties and changing materials\nYear 6 Topics\nLight\nThe circulatory system\nClassification\nEvolution and inheritance\nElectricity\nReligion, Philosophy and Ethics is taught across the school as a vital component in preparing our children for life in modern Britain by helping them to develop an in depth understanding of the different faiths and cultures which make up our diverse society. The two key aims of religious education at Breaside are to enable pupils to understand and reflect upon the religious and spiritual beliefs, practices, insights and experiences that are expressed in humanity’s search for meaning in life and to provide opportunities for pupils to explore and express their own responses and personal beliefs. Our curriculum is designed so that all pupils know and understand a range of religions and world views, have opportunities to express ideas and insights about the nature, significance and impact of these and gain and deploy the skills needed to engage seriously with them. Throughout the school, children are given the opportunity to acquire knowledge and understanding of the six major world religions as well as navigating a selection of carefully crafted Philosophy and Ethics units; these promote an enquiry based approach to learning where children consider the value of their ideas and the ideas of others as well as gain the confidence to ask questions and learn through discussion and debate. Alongside its academic outcomes, our RPE curriculum encourages children to develop positive attitudes including empathy, tolerance, respect, commitment and a sense of appreciation and wonder for the world around them; all of which we at Breaside value as important personal characteristics.\nPSHE – Breaside adopts a mindful approach to PSHE education and is a proud member of the Jigsaw scheme, a whole school approach to personal, social, health and economic education. From Foundation Stage to Year 6, our children are taught to understand and value who they are and how they fit in and contribute to the world around them. Each term, children participate in a range of age appropriate and tailored PSHE lessons, events and initiatives, each one designed to promote and embed the following units of study: Being Me in My World, Celebrating Differences, Dreams and Goals, Healthy Me, Relationships and Changing Me. The Jigsaw scheme aims to fully prepare children for contemporary life and is fully compliant with the 2020 statutory DfE guidance surrounding the teaching of relationships and health education. As such important issues including e-safety, bullying and positive self-image (amongst many others) are sensitively taught in a safe and supportive environment, where open and honest communication is both encouraged and valued. At Breaside, we also offer a comprehensive sex education programme which not only prepares children for life as a teenager, but also empowers them with the ability to make informed decisions about their bodies and personal lifestyle choices. As a result, our children leave Breaside as resilient, considerate, confident and optimistic young people who are very well prepared for the demands and challenges of the modern world. Please note that further details of our sex and relationships education and Jigsaw schemes of work can be found in our school policy.","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/key-stages/junior/"}

Lessons are either provided by staff from Bromley Youth Music Trust (known as BYMT) or by self-employed visiting music teachers.\nWhat can students learn? \nWe are currently able to offer individual lessons to pupils who are in Years 1-6 on the following instruments: \nStrings: Violin, Viola, Cello\nWoodwind: Flute, Saxophone, Clarinet, Recorder\nFife, Toot, J-Sax, Dood are smaller versions of wind instruments that may be more suitable for beginners, and the teacher will advise.\nBrass: Trumpet, Cornet, Trombone, Baritone\nOther: Drum kit, Singing, Guitar, Piano\nWhen and where will they have the lessons? \nLessons take place during the school day. Pupils come out of lessons to attend, but the timetable is worked out on a rotation basis so they do not miss the same lesson each week.\nHow much do lessons cost? \n£200 per term for individual 30 minute lessons\n£133 per term for individual 20 minute lessons\n£100 per term for individual 15 minute lessons\nHow do I pay? \nOnce we have received your application/agreement forms, we will pass your details to one of our teachers and you will receive an invoice and other information from them.\nAre there any instrumental/vocal lessons you would particularly recommend? \nAll are as worthwhile as each other, but do bear in mind that orchestral instruments such as violin, cello, flute etc are ideal first instruments that can play together in ensembles, and so your child will be able to make music with their friends more quickly. For any instrument the most important thing is that your child attends lessons regularly and practises during the week. Just ten minutes a day can make all the difference to progress! \nWhat do I do about obtaining an instrument? \nIf you are applying for piano lessons you will need a piano at home. Some children do start by learning on an electric keyboard, but this is quite a different instrument and progress in the long term will be hampered. If you decide to buy/hire an instrument please seek advice before doing so. We recommend hiring from the Music Hub at BYMT or Saunders Music. Please visit their websites for further information: BYMT https://musichubsales.org.uk 07768 312270 and Saunders Music http://www.saundersmusic.co.uk 01732 740755\nWe are also in the process of buying some high quality smaller sized melody instruments for beginners that you can rent from school. Please contact Mrs Eastwood for details.\nHow do I apply for music lessons? \nSimply fill in the online form below and return it to Mrs Eastwood at chrissy.eastwood@breaside.co.uk\nWhen do lessons start? \nThe first set of 10 (out of 30) lessons commence in September. It is possible to apply for lessons at any point in the school year, however we often have a waiting list therefore children may have to wait until a slot becomes available.\nWhat happens if we want to stop music lessons? \nYou need to email/write to Mrs Eastwood and the instrumental teacher by half term. Lessons can only stop at the end of a set of 10 – not part way through.\nWill learning an instrument help my child’s education? \nYes, we believe so. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that children learning an instrument not only improve their social and practical skills, but their progress and achievement in other subjects increases as they develop their listening, comprehension and reading skills.\nIf you wish to proceed with an application then please fill in this online form – https://forms.office.com/e/ENtjM2uTuY","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/school-life/extra-curricular/"}

It can be easy to talk about but hard to pin down. Culture is often seen as:\nThe way we do things around here\nToday, I was at Breaside Prep School in Bromley, UK. I first visited Breaside in 2015 and, for me, it is always a special place. Why? There are many reasons, but one is the culture of the school. The culture is is displayed through so many observable signs.\nI always stand with the leadership team on the school gate as children and parents enter. Without exception, every child says, ‘good morning’ and engages with the school’s leaders. Sometimes a few words, sometimes a full conversation; but always a meaningful connection.\nI notice that children look out for each other. They show genuine care and encouragement for their classmates. They ‘wrap an arm around’, sometimes physically and sometimes metaphorically. This isn’t for show, it is just the way it is.\nI observe the quality of work displayed around the school is always high quality and honours children’s effort and progress.\nI could go on as there are many more. These all point to something important, detail matters. It matters because these contribute to the school’s culture.\nThis is a school that deeply values academic outcomes, that offers a genuinely holistic education and embeds a culture of wellbeing. This is all wrapped in intentional care – care for each other, care for our relationships and care for learning.\nOur Cognita Framework includes a strategic pillar identifying the importance of leadership in every school. One of our contributors to leadership is ‘A culture that has been intentionally created and managed through trust and empowerment’. We use the word ‘contributor’ because we see that culture ‘contributes to’ the student experience and outcomes.\nBreaside shows how the culture is intentionally managed and nothing is left to chance. It is a school that achieves great outcomes for each child. For\nsure, this is a result of lots of hard work from the whole team. But we shouldn’t underplay the importance of culture in creating the place that this hard work happens.\nFor sure, culture is conceptual. But, there are many indicators that culture is absolutely tangible. Nothing happens by chance. It needs intentional nurturing and persistent attention to make sure it is ‘the way we do things around here’ – everyday.\nDr Simon Camby\nChief Education Officer\nCognita Global Group","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/blog/"}

She is also very happy to be there. All the teachers and staff are so welcoming from the second you set foot on the premises. The parent to teacher communication is also brilliant. There is a good structure to the day and throughout the term. We as parents are told what they will be doing each week. We also get access to pictures, videos and regular updates of what the child has been doing via an online portal. Highly recommend this school.\nPre Prep Parent\nFantastic school with good structured learning from a young age, lots of variety in activities and great approachable staff. My son has greatly developed in understanding, reading and language since joining in 2019. The staff have been amazing through the pandemic in providing the children with a structured learning plan to keep them on track!\nYear 3 Parent\nSchool is a platform where we send our children to be educated and to create a base on which they can build their future. I cannot see any other better place for younger children than Breaside Preparatory School in Bromley who ranked 24th in UK, what an outstanding achievement! Breaside is a prestigious and inspiring school, which provides a rich and healthy learning environment to children which is why we selected this school for my son. \nWe moved my son from a state school to Breaside just 4 months ago and the difference we are witnessing with him his enormous. Breaside has given my son endless opportunities to thrive, made him extremely confident, well disciplined, and very creative, opening up his potential to the full. All the Teachers are so friendly, knowledgeable, and full of enthusiasm and passion. Mrs Nicholson, the Executive Principal, is an institution in herself. Her everyday presence, motivation, inspiration and direction makes this school outstanding more than any other independent school in the region. Each and every student is individually assessed, cared for and get proper attention. \nThe school has so much foresight that they gave each and every Junior student a laptop just before the Christmas break. That has really made it possible to do online learning in this dreadful pandemic. Even in these adverse circumstances they keep educating and teaching children. It is so hard and difficult a task to do online but the school and teachers are putting their utmost sincere efforts and time into doing so. Along with English, Maths, verbal and non verbal reasoning, the school provides a high class education in History, Geography, Music, PE and sports including rugby, cricket, football, netball and swimming. \nMoving my son to Breaside was the best decision I took for my son. Thank you Breaside for everything you have done for my son. \nYear 3 Parent\nI cannot say enough thank you to all of you and all the teachers for home learning. What a fantastic schedule, commitment and dedication from all teachers in these adverse circumstances. Hats off to all of you.

My hat goes off to you for all your sublime calm and patience!\nYear 3 Parent\nI cannot thank you both enough for what you are doing for online learning. You are both doing an amazing job. It is tough and difficult to manage so many students from remote site, really appreciate your efforts and time.\nReception Parent\nJust wanted to say a big thank you for all the hard work that’s been put in to provide the home learning. I know there was very short notice this time round but the children have still been provided with lots to do and we are hugely impressed and grateful. \nThe music that was added to use during the handwriting practice was brilliant, our son sat and completed it with no complaints whilst listening so thank you so much for that. \nThank you for all you and the team at Breaside are doing it is so appreciated.\nYear 2 and Year 3 Parent\nOur utmost thanks from us for offering provision for key worker children as both myself and my husband would not be able to do our jobs otherwise.\nYear 3 Parent\nAll the teachers are doing a wonderful job, and this can’t be easy for you all. Good luck for all the future lessons and fingers crossed for schools to be able to reopen again soon.\nReception Parent\nYou have done such an amazing job this week, our daughter has loved getting back into learning!\nReception Parent\nHonestly, you are brilliant. My daughter was engaged the whole lesson which was fantastic for me as I was able to get on with my work. Really appreciate all the work that must go on behind the scenes too with the changing plans. Thanks again.\nBreaside School Parent\nSending both our children to Breaside was one of the best decisions we have ever made. The teaching staff have delivered an outstanding education. Not only has the academic side been superb but both our children have loved being at Breaside which is such a happy place.\nBreaside School Parent\nThis year has been different for everyone, all the staff at Breaside have shown how much they care about the children. Breaside has gone above and beyond what we could have expected in such a difficult situation. We have been so impressed and we thank everyone for all their hard work.\nBreaside School Parent\nThank you for everything the school has done over what has been a very challenging term. The quality of the teaching both on-line and back in the classroom has been absolutely outstanding and we feel extremely grateful that our children were at Breaside during this term.\nBreaside School Parent\nThe structure given to the Early Years made a very obvious impact on both our children when they moved from another pre-school to Breaside.\nBreaside School Parent\nOur daughter has shown great all round progress in her development since joining Breaside.\nBreaside School Parent\nVery happy with the school teaching and encouragement of children.

We may process sensitive personal data in the following circumstances:\n3.6.1 in limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent;\n3.6.2 where we need to carry out our legal obligations;\n3.6.3 where it is needed in the public interest;\n3.6.4 for safeguarding;\n3.6.5 about you child’s physical or mental health, or disability status, to ensure health and safety to provide appropriate adjustments, to monitor and manage sickness absence and to administer care; and\n3.6.6 about your race or national or ethnic origin, to e.g. for dietary requirements.\nInformation we collect about you from our website\n3.7 We will use this information for the following legitimate interests:\n3.7.1 to contact you if you have made an enquiry to one of our schools via our online enquiry form;\n3.7.2 to administer our website and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;\n3.7.3 to improve our website to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner, and your online experience is as effective and appropriate as possible, for you and for your computer;\n3.7.4 to allow you and your child to participate in interactive features of our service, for example virtual learning environments, when you choose to do so; and\n3.7.5 as part of our efforts to keep our website safe and secure.\nInformation we receive from other sources 3.8 We may combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We may use this information and the combined information for one of the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive). For example, we may receive a court order relating to you which impacts on our use of your and your child’s information to protect the welfare of the child. 3.9 Also, social services, health practitioners or public authorities may provide us with information (particularly sensitive personal data) about your child which may need to be added to the school’s child protection or special educational needs file. This kind of processing of sensitive personal data may be necessary (a) for the purposes of carrying out our obligations in the field of social security or social protection law, (b) for medical diagnosis or provision of health care and/or (c) to protect the vital interests of your child or another person taking into account the mental and physical capacity of your child.\n3.10 In order to achieve the purposes described in paragraph 3.9, our schools may do the following:\n3.10.1 keep a list of your child’s allergies or medical requirements within the classroom or staffroom in case of emergency. It is necessary for the school to have a list readily available to our staff so that we are able to look after your child promptly in the event of a medical emergency; and\n3.10.2 rely on software applications and other technology to process medical information (such as allergies, accidents and injuries) about you and your children. For further information on the kind of technology we use, particularly in the context of processing sensitive personal data about your child, please contact our Data Protection Officer or Data Protection Co-ordinator (see paragraph 9).\nWhen we disclose information\n3.11 In order to pursue one of the legitimate interests set out above, we may share your and your child’s personal information with:\n3.11.1 Cognita School Support Centre in the UK;\n3.11.2 a member of the Cognita group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006;\n3.11.3 local authorities, education authorities (for example, Ofsted), the Department for Education, SEN co-ordinators, social services or the police where we have reason to believe there are safeguarding concerns in respect of your child;\n3.11.4 exam boards (for example, AQA, Cambridge Assessment, OCR, Pearson and WJEC) in order to successfully administer exams;\n3.11.5 where your child is not British, we may have to provide information about you or your child to UK Visas and Immigration;\n3.11.6 business partners, professional advisors, debt collector, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you; and\n3.11.7 credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.\n3.12 We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use the terms of the parents’ contract (between us and you) and other agreements. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\nWhere we need to get your consent\n3.13 We will not market services to you (other than in accordance with paragraph 3.1.7 or 3.1.9 above) without your consent and you have the right to ask us not to use your contact details for marketing.\n3.14 We will ask you to complete our Photo Consent Form for specific permission to use photos of your child.\n3.15 You or your child do not have to give us details about your child’s race, religion or ethnicity if you do not want to. If you do provide us with this information, we only use these details to assist us with the day-to-day running of the school (for example, if your child’s religion means that he or she has particular dietary requirements then we will of course be much better informed if we have this information to cater to your child’s requirements) and for equal opportunities monitoring purposes.\nWhere you have given consent to the above, you can withdraw marketing consent at any time by unsubscribing here, resubmitting your Photo Consent Form, or by contacting the Data Protection Coordinator (see paragraph 9). \n4 TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE UK OR THE EEA\n4.1 The data that we process about you and your child may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UK or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We try to limit this where possible but it may be necessary where, for example, one of our suppliers has a data centre outside the UK or the EEA. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your and your child’s data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice and that the appropriate legal safeguards are in place prior to the transfer, for example ensuring that any contracts between us and the recipient of the information have standard data protection clauses, or the country we are transferring the data to is deemed by the UK Government as adequate.\n5 YOUR RIGHTS \n5.1 Under the Data Protection Legislation, you and your child have the following rights:\n5.1.1 Right to correction. You have the right to have inaccurate personal data about you or your child rectified.\n5.1.2 The right to erasure. You have the right to request that we delete your and your child’s personal data where: (a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or processed; (b) you withdraw your consent to processing for which we previously obtained your consent; (c) you object to the processing and, as a result, we agree to cease that processing (please see paragraph 5.1.5 for more details); (d) the personal data has been unlawfully processed; and (e) we are required to erase the personal data in order to comply with the law.\n5.1.3 Right to restriction. You have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing where: (a) you contest the accuracy of the personal data we hold about you; (b) the personal data has been unlawfully processed; (c) we no longer need the personal data but they are required in limited circumstances; and (d) you object to the processing and, as a result, we agree to cease that processing (please see paragraph 5.1.5 for more details).\n5.1.4 Right to request transfer. In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transmit it to a third party organisation.\n5.1.5 Right to object. You have the right to raise an objection to any of our processing in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2. Please tell us if you object to any type of processing that we do and we will work with you to address any concerns you may have.\n5.1.6 Right to object to marketing. If you do not want us to process your personal data for direct marketing, please tell us and we will ensure that we no longer do this.\n5.1.7 Right to complain to the ICO. Whilst we would always prefer it if you approached us first about any complaints or queries you may have; you always have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n5.1.8 Right to request access. You have the right to access personal data we hold about you. We encourage you to contact the school’s Data Protection Co-ordinator and request our standard SAR form for you to complete in order to help us process your request. \n6 HOW LONG WE KEEP PERSONAL INFORMATION\n6.1 We will not keep any personal data about you for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.\n6.2 As a general rule, we keep your child’s education records until they reach 25 years of age at which point, we destroy the file. This is regardless of whether their file has been transferred to another school, in the event that your child transfers schools.\n6.3 We follow a personal data retention policy which determines how long we keep specific types of personal information for. For further information about the criteria we use to determine what periods we keep specific information, please contact our Data Protection Officer or Data Protection Co-ordinator (see paragraph 9).\n7 COOKIES\n7.1 Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website.

The school seeks to ensure that all relevant legal obligations of the school parents and pupils are complied with and that all processing of data is done lawfully and fairly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The school has a comprehensive policy covering data governance and is registered with the Information Commissioners office.\nPlease address any enquiries to the School office.\nAll school policy documents are accessible for parents from the school office.\nIt is also possible to access the number of formal complaints received in the previous academic year by application to the School Office.\nAnti-Bullying Alliance\nTogether we can stop bullying and create safe environments in which children and young people can live, grow, play and learn. Cognita Schools has signed up to eradicate bullying in our schools, working in partnership as an associate member of the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA); based at the renowned charity, the National Children’s Bureau in London. ABA is a coalition of organisations and individuals working together to stop bullying. ABA coordinates anti-bullying week each November and is the national voice for evidence-based practice in this field. We access specialist training for all our schools, respect difference and welcome diversity. Our schools’ anti-bullying policies support the values of ABA. We believe that bullying in any form is wrong and should not be tolerated. It is a behaviour choice and anyone can be encouraged to change their behaviour. We believe that children have the right to feel safe, secure and valued and that creating a safe environment and dealing with bullying is everyone’s responsibility. We support a range of positive strategies in our schools to tackle and prevent bullying. We actively challenge the use of humiliation, fear, ridicule and other similar approaches. Our policy is implemented whenever the school is responsible for the conduct and welfare of children. As successful schools, we create an environment that prevents bullying from being a serious problem in the first place. Schools that excel at tackling bullying have created an ethos of good behaviour where pupils treat one another and school staff with respect because they know it is the right way to behave.\nFind out more about the Anti-Bullying Alliance.\nMillie’s Mark\nMillie’s Mark is awarded as a special endorsement to childcare providers that go above and beyond the minimum requirements by having 100% of staff trained in paediatric first aid, and also ensuring that everything learned during the course is kept alive and in the forefront of practitioners’ minds so that they are confident, ready and capable.\nCEOP Help support and advice centre\nNeed immediate help?\nDo you need immediate help or have a real emergency?

At this point Breaside was an all boys school.\n1973\nBetween 1973 and 1990, the School was owned and run by the Armstead family and, when they retired, a group of parents took over.\n1993\nBreaside needed investment, although it still enjoyed an excellent reputation locally. It was at this point that Asquith Court Schools acquired the School.\n1994\nWhen a local school, Beresford Girls School, closed Breaside invited its first girls to join and the school became Co-Educational.\n2004\nAsquith Court Schools were bought by Cognita Ltd, a new education company chaired by Sir Chris Woodhead, the first Chief Inspector of Schools. Cognita has 85 schools in its portfolio and is the largest independent schools provider in the UK, Europe and Asia.\nBreaside has a character all of its own – a real ‘buzz’ around the building, from our youngest children in the Early Years all the way up to our Year 6 children preparing for the next steps in their journey. It is this buzz that captures the heart of Breaside, a truly unique place where importance is placed on celebrating the individual and the belief that all of our children can be anything that they want to be. Our school is a place where children are happy, confident and proud of their achievements, both inside and out of the classroom.\nWe take great pride in our long standing academic success and place high importance on inspiring a true love of learning that extends beyond our classrooms, through a wide range of learning opportunities.

Rafael was selected amongst 6 children in their year 7 cohort of 62 children, to recite poetry to a parent audience of about 200 and was the very first one to go on to the stage and open the recital evening for the school. He won the prize for being the best in recital in his year!\nRafael’s success is all down to the self-belief that the education in Breaside instilled in him and also the amazing work of all his teachers whom he had the privilege of learning from during his 8 years at Breaside, that has made him into the confident young man that he is today.\nIt is always so rewarding to hear how our pupils are doing when they move onto their senior schools. Well done Rafael keep up the great work!\nAndrew Ball and his brother both used to come to Breaside in the 1950’s. He is now an author and poet and lives in America but he made contact with Mrs Nicholson during a recent visit. He would like to share a few fond memories of Breaside.\nMemory of a Belovéd Place \nLet me tell you a story.\nIt is early December in the year 1952. I am an eight-year-old boy and know everything there is to know about everything. But for reasons I’ve never fully understood, some of the teachers at Breaside Pre-Preparatory School, as it was called in those far-away days, remain unconvinced, and insist on my coming to school every weekday, rain or shine. All I care about is that Christmas is coming and before that, the end of term. I keep a calendar in my desk and mark off each day as it passes with a giant red X. \nThe school is only two years old in 1952, although I don’t know that at the time. If I’d stopped to consider, I would probably have thought it had existed forever, certainly since 1066 and All That, and probably since the Flood, with the benign Headmaster, Mr. Chater, at the helm. You need to experience the passage of time before you develop a feel for it. \nThere are no girls at the school back then, the way there are in these enlightened times, which is a relief to me because my one-term exposure to co-education at my first school, St. Mary’s Primary, had not been entirely happy. Initially, I’d been flattered by the attentions of this trio of girls who seemed eager to sit beside me at mealtimes on one of those long wooden benches, and even more delighted when they snuggled up ever closer, pushing me to the very end of the bench and giggling as I ate my lunch. But when, at some pre-arranged signal known only to the fairer sex, they all stood up, the bench tipped, and I was deposited unceremoniously onto the floor. The giggles became guffaws. You’d think I’d have learned, but in my memory, this happened every lunchtime, without fail, for the entire miserable term I spent at that school. After such repeated humiliations, Breaside was paradise. \nI had another sound reason to distrust St. Mary’s. To take me to school on my first day there at the age of five, my mother had entrusted me to the care of my elder brother, nine years my senior, knowing that he had much more authority over me than she would ever enjoy. He dragged this whining school-boy, with my satchel and shining morning face, creeping like snail unwillingly to school. Knowing him, he probably recited the entire Seven Ages of Man to keep me entertained on the journey. And in the afternoon, he came to collect me again, only to find me weeping my heart out. \n“What on earth’s the matter?” he must have asked. \n“You said they’d teach me to read,” I sobbed, “but they didn’t.” \nBut I digress; back to 1952. It must be my first day at Breaside, and my first-ever French lesson. Despite the lack of girls, I can still find humiliation without much difficulty; it’s one of the things I do best. \n“Well, folks, what’s the French for mouse?” my friendly French teacher asks. Somehow, I know the answer; I told you I knew everything back then. My hand shoots up. \n“Please, sir; it’s ‘souris’ sir.” \n“And since when is your name Foulks, Ball?” comes the stern reply. How am I supposed to know that one of my new classmates, who will become a good friend despite this rocky start to our relationship, has a homonym for a name? \nNo one who lived in or near London will ever forget the first half of December 1952… or not until the dreaded dementia kicks in, anyway. I’d better write fast. It is the time of the last great London smog: that blinding, choking, stinking blanket that descended almost every winter in those dirty days before the Clean Air Act of 1956. Year after year, thousands died, and millions suffered. In December 1952 it is particularly bad, as newspaper accounts at the time testify. In parts of London, birds fly into buildings, thieves escape unchased by police, and people can no longer see their own feet. \nBy the age of eight I am walking alone to school, a scarf tied across my face against the smog, feeling my way along the pavement to know when to turn. And it is cold this year, too. So cold that what passes for central heating in the Breaside classrooms — hissing, clanking radiators that are meant to be filled with steam but more often remain stone cold — simply isn’t up to the task. And which classroom am I in? Memory is hazy here, but it is the one on the left at the top of the stairs: 2B or not 2B? That is the question. \nAs a dispensation against the cold, we are allowed to wear our overcoats and gloves in class, and to write with pencils instead of fountain pens, because the ink is frozen in the inkwells. Either pencils, or the latest revolutionary writing implement to appear on the market, the wonderful invention of Mr. László Bíró, savior of left-handers like me. The intense cold has a silver lining. \nAfter a day or two of suffering, a paraffin stove appears miraculously in the classroom. The fire risks are all too obvious: a naked flame, surrounded by gallons of paraffin and eighteen shivering schoolboys is a disaster waiting to happen, and it won’t have to wait very long. We are instructed in no uncertain terms to stay well clear of the stove. Special routes around the classroom are mapped out to ensure that the deadly three-particle collision of paraffin, flame, and boy will never occur. \nBut fate has other things in mind. It is an English class, as I recall, and yesterday I wrote an essay of which I am inordinately — and, as it turns out, unjustifiably — proud. Expecting a star, or maybe even a G-star, I go up to the teacher’s desk to receive the accolade I’m sure is coming my way, carefully observing the new traffic patterns. \nWhat? Only 7/10 and a ‘You can do better than this’? Seventy years later, I can still relive that moment and feel the shock of this cruel appraisal of my masterpiece, whatever it was. With my nose buried in my exercise book and exuding indignation from every pore so that my teacher will know the trauma he has inflicted, I make my way back to my desk, totally forgetting the paraffin stove. Over it goes, purple flames licking across the wooden floorboards towards my seated classmates. Well, that gets my teacher’s attention all right. He rushes to douse the fire before it becomes an inferno with tomorrow’s headlines reading ‘Eighteen schoolboys fried to a crisp: Ministry to investigate’. \n“Ball, go down to the headmaster’s study and tell him what you just did.” \nI creep downstairs, my mind in turmoil seeking an escape. What can I say? Is there any way to lighten the awful burden of the news I must deliver? Any way to head off the terrible retribution that is sure to come my way? Three steps from the bottom it comes to me. This is the moment the passive voice was created for! I knock on the Headmaster’s door. \n“Yes, Ball?” \n“Please sir, the paraffin stove in 2B has been knocked over.” \nHe races past me and up the stairs to help douse the flames, which are now out. We pass as he comes back down. \n“I would have thought better of you, Ball, if you had told me that it was you who had knocked over the stove.” \nSeventy years later, I still blush with shame at the memory.\nHi, my name is Martin Brace, I am the Property Manager here at Breaside.\nHowever, this is not my first time at the school, I attended Breaside as a student myself in the late 60’s. The picture here is me on my first day at Breaside.\nBreaside School was founded by Colonel Charter in 1950, it started as the pre-preparatory school to a larger school called Carn Brea, this was next door, hence the name Breaside.\nThe two main houses were connected as they are today, and from the front it looked just the same. However, that is where the similarities end. Behind the two buildings was a large garden mainly laid to lawn. Just Boys attended back then and when students reached 9 years old, they had to leave and were generally expected to go to Carn Brea.\nCarn Brea School is pictured here, unfortunately Breaside is just outside of the picture, the site is now mainly housing. Notice all the fields behind used for the many sports activities the school was well known for. I used to enjoy using their swimming pool.\nSo, here we are many years later. I was delighted to find Breaside had evolved into a 21st Century school and become such an excellent one! The Team here are amazing and I feel very proud to count myself among them.\nI am passionate about the school and look forward to working to improve it even further, moving forward, we have lots of plans in the pipeline to enhance the children’s learning environment. I hope the problems we now have do not slow this down too much.\nToday we face the challenge of making the school safe for the students return. The maintenance team have been working to make sure the appropriate steps are taken to put everything in place. Measures which have already been completed include the installation of gel washing stations, signage, and cleaning systems around the school. Working with the teachers we have been clearing the classrooms of soft furnishings, soft toys and anything that cannot be regularly sanitised. Our aim is to disinfect the school in its entirely twice daily upon the student’s return. Rooms have been reconfigured to ensure two-meter distancing, and year groups spread over multiple classrooms.\nAfter so much preparation to ensure the safety of the students and staff, we are looking forward to welcoming the children’s return.\nI look forward to meeting you all. Stay Safe.\nMartin Brace","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/about-us/alumni/"}

We consider sport to be an integral part of education and development.\nA full calendar is published at the start of each term which contains a full programme of matches and tournaments against other schools at many of the different age groups and levels of competition. In all areas of sport, a sense of fair play and team spirit are encouraged as well as a healthy desire to win fairly and to lose graciously.\nOur Sports Days are held in the summer term to which all parents are invited. As well as making full use of our own facilities, the school also has use of the local cricket club http://www.bromleycricketclub.org.uk/ for lessons and where some of our fixtures are played against other schools\nMathematics\nIntroduction\nAt Breaside Preparatory School the teaching of Mathematics reflects the enormous depth and brevity of the subject. The dedicated Mathematics staff at the school provide challenging work that reflects the high standards that our children achieve in Mathematics.\nThe National Numeracy Strategy\nBreaside Preparatory School is guided by the National Numeracy Strategy (NNS) to a large degree. A high priority is placed upon the development of basic skills at Breaside. We devote at least five hours of teaching time per week to the development of mathematical skills and understanding.\nThe NNS defines numeracy and the characteristics of the “numerate pupil” on p.4, Section 1. We accept those definitions and share the view expounded in the NNS of the factors that pronounce high standards in numeracy (pp.4-5)\nBreaside has naturally developed its own approach to the teaching of Mathematics and we have thus selected the resources that we feel are best suited to our purpose, taking into account particular local conditions which might influence the organisation and pace of our curriculum.\nThe NNS is an extremely detailed and practical document. The broad framework is helpful in ensuring the balanced coverage of the Attainment Targets for Mathematics at Breaside – Number, Shape, Space and Measures: Handling Data.\nIt is important to understand that no separate programme of study is defined for ssing and applying Mathematics, as it should pervade each of the three Attainment Targets.\nThe Breaside Mathematics Curriculum achieves all of the requirements of the NNS and indeeds goes further – it comprehensively ensures that all pupils experience and develop an ability to apply their aquired skills and knowledge appropriately to a variety of mathematical situations.\nBreaside serves the needs of a particular community and as such has its own approach to teaching and learning. We are however guided and informed in our approach by the ‘Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage’, by the National Curriculum orders for Key Stage 1 and 2 and by the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. We enter our pupils for National Curriculum Key Stage 2 SATs and Key Stage 1 SATs therefore, we ensure thorough coverage of the knowledge, skills and understanding required for those tests.\nA broad range of ability is evident amongst our pupils at Breaside. There will be those pupils for whom the agreed expectations will be a considerable challenge, others whose achievements will take them beyond the general expectation. Where it is approriate, work will be planned to differentiate (by task or by outcome) between pupils of varied ability. At Breaside, differentiation is also planned through ‘grouping’ or ‘setting’ strategies.\nAims – Breaside Mathematics \nThe Aims of our department include:\nRecognition and understanding of the ways in which children acquire mathematical understanding.\nFacilitation of the pupil’s Mathematical skills acquisition so that they are able to engage in practical activities, explorations and discussions to develop an understanding, knowledge of and love for Mathematics.\nCoherence and continuity – to ensure that at each successive stage, skills and knowledge are consolidated and built upon.\nMathematics should be fun. Mathematics is a creative discipline and should be used to ‘..understand and change the world’ (NNS)\nWe must help pupils (at particular stages) to develop appropriate examination ‘techniques’ and must provide opportunities for the practice of those techniques.\nIn summary our aim is to provide children with a comprehensive range of mental and written strategies, with mathematical understanding and with the ability to recognise, with confidence, the mathematics that must be applied to the solution of a variety of problems – a fusion of the mechanical and the creative.\nMore detailed information is available about each individual year group by clicking on the following links:\nYear 3\nNational Curriculum guidelines for the teaching of Mathematics are followed, using the Heinemann Maths Scheme Level 4 and a wealth of independent resources.

We have an interactive whiteboard, a dedicated set of i-pads and access to numerous and varied IT resources to support the teaching of science topics. We are keen to develop inquisitive minds and pupil’s practical skills and take an investigative approach to science topics wherever possible.\nScience lessons also take place in outdoor areas within the school grounds and a number of student led projects take place throughout the year.\nAims \nOur main aims in teaching science at Breaside are: \nTo help the children to understand the world about them by learning about a wide range of living things, materials and physical phenomena.\nTo show the children that Science is relevant to them and their everyday lives.\nTo encourage the children to use and apply their scientific knowledge and their own ideas to explain events occurring around them.\nTo develop their methods of scientific enquiry. Investigative work encourages teamwork, co-operation, communication skills, and originality of thought.\nFinally, we hope to stimulate pupils’ curiosity and sense of wonder when they explore the natural and the physical world.\nThe teaching of science\nWe follow the programmes of study for Key Stage 2 set out in the New National Curriculum Science.\nScience is taught through a series of individual topics and is underpinned by knowledge and skills gained through working scientifically. \nWorking Scientifically in Years 3 and 4\nThroughout Years 3 and 4 pupils will be given a wide variety of opportunities for working scientifically. They will ask their own questions about the world around them and will start to decide how they can set up scientific enquiries to answer them. They will be given opportunities to group, sort, and classify items developing communication and justification skills. Pupils will start to look for patterns and will decide on the type of data that is needed to identify these. They will begin to make their own decisions on what observations to make, their frequency and what type of equipment is needed. Pupils will be gaining independence in measuring and recording their data and will be guided into drawing simple conclusions. They will also start to decide if results may be erroneous, and what steps could be taken to improve an investigation. The learning, spelling and appropriate use of scientific vocabulary will develop throughout the whole of Key Stage 2.\nYear 3 Topics\nLight and shadows\nKeeping Healthy – diet, bones, muscles and movement\nRocks, soils and fossils\nForces and magnets\nPlants\nOutdoor studies – observation of changes to plants throughout the seasons\nYear 4 Topics\nSound\nDigestion, teeth and food chains\nHuman Impact on the environment\nSolids, liquids, gases and changes of state\nElectricity\nIntroduction to classification\nWorking Scientifically in Years 5 and 6\nDuring the upper Key Stage 2 years, pupils will further develop existing working scientifically skills. They will become more systematic in asking questions and analysing relationships and will become confident in planning appropriate investigations to answer specific scientific questions. Pupils will make their own decisions concerning frequency, duration and equipment for measurements, and will decide how to record data so that they can look for evidence that supports or refutes their ideas. Our aim is for all pupils to be able to draw conclusions based on their data and observations, use evidence to justify their ideas and use their scientific knowledge and understanding to explain their findings. Relevant scientific language and illustrations are used to discuss, communicate and justify pupil’s scientific ideas, and we discuss how scientific ideas have developed and changed over time.\nYear 5 Topics\nLife cycles\nReproduction in plants and animals\nForces\nEarth and space\nProperties and changing materials\nYear 6 Topics\nLight\nThe circulatory system\nClassification\nEvolution and inheritance\nElectricity\nReligion, Philosophy and Ethics is taught across the school as a vital component in preparing our children for life in modern Britain by helping them to develop an in depth understanding of the different faiths and cultures which make up our diverse society. The two key aims of religious education at Breaside are to enable pupils to understand and reflect upon the religious and spiritual beliefs, practices, insights and experiences that are expressed in humanity’s search for meaning in life and to provide opportunities for pupils to explore and express their own responses and personal beliefs. Our curriculum is designed so that all pupils know and understand a range of religions and world views, have opportunities to express ideas and insights about the nature, significance and impact of these and gain and deploy the skills needed to engage seriously with them. Throughout the school, children are given the opportunity to acquire knowledge and understanding of the six major world religions as well as navigating a selection of carefully crafted Philosophy and Ethics units; these promote an enquiry based approach to learning where children consider the value of their ideas and the ideas of others as well as gain the confidence to ask questions and learn through discussion and debate. Alongside its academic outcomes, our RPE curriculum encourages children to develop positive attitudes including empathy, tolerance, respect, commitment and a sense of appreciation and wonder for the world around them; all of which we at Breaside value as important personal characteristics.\nPSHE – Breaside adopts a mindful approach to PSHE education and is a proud member of the Jigsaw scheme, a whole school approach to personal, social, health and economic education. From Foundation Stage to Year 6, our children are taught to understand and value who they are and how they fit in and contribute to the world around them. Each term, children participate in a range of age appropriate and tailored PSHE lessons, events and initiatives, each one designed to promote and embed the following units of study: Being Me in My World, Celebrating Differences, Dreams and Goals, Healthy Me, Relationships and Changing Me. The Jigsaw scheme aims to fully prepare children for contemporary life and is fully compliant with the 2020 statutory DfE guidance surrounding the teaching of relationships and health education. As such important issues including e-safety, bullying and positive self-image (amongst many others) are sensitively taught in a safe and supportive environment, where open and honest communication is both encouraged and valued. At Breaside, we also offer a comprehensive sex education programme which not only prepares children for life as a teenager, but also empowers them with the ability to make informed decisions about their bodies and personal lifestyle choices. As a result, our children leave Breaside as resilient, considerate, confident and optimistic young people who are very well prepared for the demands and challenges of the modern world. Please note that further details of our sex and relationships education and Jigsaw schemes of work can be found in our school policy.","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/key-stages/junior/"}

Lessons are either provided by staff from Bromley Youth Music Trust (known as BYMT) or by self-employed visiting music teachers.\nWhat can students learn? \nWe are currently able to offer individual lessons to pupils who are in Years 1-6 on the following instruments: \nStrings: Violin, Viola, Cello\nWoodwind: Flute, Saxophone, Clarinet, Recorder\nFife, Toot, J-Sax, Dood are smaller versions of wind instruments that may be more suitable for beginners, and the teacher will advise.\nBrass: Trumpet, Cornet, Trombone, Baritone\nOther: Drum kit, Singing, Guitar, Piano\nWhen and where will they have the lessons? \nLessons take place during the school day. Pupils come out of lessons to attend, but the timetable is worked out on a rotation basis so they do not miss the same lesson each week.\nHow much do lessons cost? \n£200 per term for individual 30 minute lessons\n£133 per term for individual 20 minute lessons\n£100 per term for individual 15 minute lessons\nHow do I pay? \nOnce we have received your application/agreement forms, we will pass your details to one of our teachers and you will receive an invoice and other information from them.\nAre there any instrumental/vocal lessons you would particularly recommend? \nAll are as worthwhile as each other, but do bear in mind that orchestral instruments such as violin, cello, flute etc are ideal first instruments that can play together in ensembles, and so your child will be able to make music with their friends more quickly. For any instrument the most important thing is that your child attends lessons regularly and practises during the week. Just ten minutes a day can make all the difference to progress! \nWhat do I do about obtaining an instrument? \nIf you are applying for piano lessons you will need a piano at home. Some children do start by learning on an electric keyboard, but this is quite a different instrument and progress in the long term will be hampered. If you decide to buy/hire an instrument please seek advice before doing so. We recommend hiring from the Music Hub at BYMT or Saunders Music. Please visit their websites for further information: BYMT https://musichubsales.org.uk 07768 312270 and Saunders Music http://www.saundersmusic.co.uk 01732 740755\nWe are also in the process of buying some high quality smaller sized melody instruments for beginners that you can rent from school. Please contact Mrs Eastwood for details.\nHow do I apply for music lessons? \nSimply fill in the online form below and return it to Mrs Eastwood at chrissy.eastwood@breaside.co.uk\nWhen do lessons start? \nThe first set of 10 (out of 30) lessons commence in September. It is possible to apply for lessons at any point in the school year, however we often have a waiting list therefore children may have to wait until a slot becomes available.\nWhat happens if we want to stop music lessons? \nYou need to email/write to Mrs Eastwood and the instrumental teacher by half term. Lessons can only stop at the end of a set of 10 – not part way through.\nWill learning an instrument help my child’s education? \nYes, we believe so. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that children learning an instrument not only improve their social and practical skills, but their progress and achievement in other subjects increases as they develop their listening, comprehension and reading skills.\nIf you wish to proceed with an application then please fill in this online form – https://forms.office.com/e/ENtjM2uTuY","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/school-life/extra-curricular/"}

Whilst the past twelve months have certainly posed many challenges, never have we been prouder of the resilience, independence and creativeness shown by our children.\nThere has been a step change in the world of learning, undoubtedly accelerated by the pandemic, and a digital revolution is transforming our classrooms, bringing together technology and traditional methods like never before. The smooth transition between the classroom and online learning has become essential and a hybrid learning experience is unlocking endless opportunities for our students to develop the skills they will need beyond school.\nIn preparation for their digital future, we have developed a comprehensive digital learning programme for our students which integrates the most beneficial aspects of digital education into our high-quality provision. All students in Year 3 and above are equipped with their own personal learning device for use both at school and home, which enables not only a seamless switch between class based and virtual learning, but also allows our teachers to use technology in the best way possible to support personalised learning; from providing feedback through to developing peer-to-peer collaboration skills. Whilst they will not replace traditional classroom teaching, these devices have the power to enhance the outstanding teaching and learning at Breaside and both students and teachers are benefitting from the technology that supports our children’s learning.\nThe value that hybrid learning brings to Breaside is incalculable; it reimagines the way that our students learn, blending the best of traditional classroom methods with EdTech that enriches digital literacy, strengthening our fundamental tailored approach to learning.

We ensure that each and every family is supported at every step in what can seem a rather long, winding road, which starts from the moment that your children join us. Knowing and understanding your child is key and we are passionate in developing these relationships right through to Year 6. Having enjoyed travelling alongside them throughout their Breaside journey, we are always so proud when the time does come for our children to fly the nest, whether that be to local independent, grammar or state schools, or somewhere further afield.\nThe level of care and knowledge that we have at Breaside for each of our children allows us to assist families in shortlisting a selection of schools that will really enable your child to thrive. The relationship that we have built up over many successful years with schools in our surrounding area is very strong and enables us to be in the privileged position of working in partnership with them to highlight not only our children’s academic achievements but also their many other skills and talents as unique individuals. Along this pathway, our Executive Principal, Senior Leaders and teaching team meet regularly with parents and children to discuss their aspirations, and the progress towards these, and ensure that they feel thoroughly supported and content in the knowledge that they have found the school where their child will continue to flourish.\nAt Breaside, we understand that the transition to Senior school, and all the preceding preparation can be a time of anxiety, so we work closely with families to support our children, helping them build the skills and independence they will need to head into assessments, interviews and open days with confidence. Our varied and inspiring curriculum extends throughout the whole of a Breaside education, from Early Years through to Year 6. Thorough preparation for 11+ entrance exams is an integral part of our children’s learning, from our challenging curriculum to timetabled reasoning lessons and taught study skills. In Year 6 this extends into critical thinking, presentation skills, interview practice, scholarship preparation and regular exam practice so that every child is equipped and confident and for their secondary school entrance tests, and beyond.\nEach year Breaside hosts a Schools Information Evening for our Year 5 families, where our knowledgeable staff present information on the process of applying for schools, key dates and important documents to support that process, and those very important deadlines for 11+ application! This evening also gives both children and their parents the chance to meet Headteachers and staff from a range of Secondary schools and, most importantly, Breaside alumni, giving them the chance to hear first-hand their own inspiring experiences of moving on into Year 7.\nPost 11+, our Year 6 children enjoy a dynamic and enriched programme of activities once all their entrance exams are finally behind them. Designed to enable the transition into Year 7 to be as smooth as possible, but also designed for a lot of fun, the schedule includes cultural visits and exhibitions, team building experiences, sports leadership, entrepreneurship and, of course, visits from our ex-Breaside pupils who come and share all of the wonderful things that they have been up to since moving on to their new schools. The pinnacle of this post 11+ programme is always the annual residential trip where our Year 6 children develop independence and key life skills that will support them not only for this transition to secondary school but for life as well rounded individuals who are now ready for the wider world.","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/blog/breaside-passion-and-enthusiasm-for-learning/"}

It can be easy to talk about but hard to pin down. Culture is often seen as:\nThe way we do things around here\nToday, I was at Breaside Prep School in Bromley, UK. I first visited Breaside in 2015 and, for me, it is always a special place. Why? There are many reasons, but one is the culture of the school. The culture is is displayed through so many observable signs.\nI always stand with the leadership team on the school gate as children and parents enter. Without exception, every child says, ‘good morning’ and engages with the school’s leaders. Sometimes a few words, sometimes a full conversation; but always a meaningful connection.\nI notice that children look out for each other. They show genuine care and encouragement for their classmates. They ‘wrap an arm around’, sometimes physically and sometimes metaphorically. This isn’t for show, it is just the way it is.\nI observe the quality of work displayed around the school is always high quality and honours children’s effort and progress.\nI could go on as there are many more. These all point to something important, detail matters. It matters because these contribute to the school’s culture.\nThis is a school that deeply values academic outcomes, that offers a genuinely holistic education and embeds a culture of wellbeing. This is all wrapped in intentional care – care for each other, care for our relationships and care for learning.\nOur Cognita Framework includes a strategic pillar identifying the importance of leadership in every school. One of our contributors to leadership is ‘A culture that has been intentionally created and managed through trust and empowerment’. We use the word ‘contributor’ because we see that culture ‘contributes to’ the student experience and outcomes.\nBreaside shows how the culture is intentionally managed and nothing is left to chance. It is a school that achieves great outcomes for each child. For\nsure, this is a result of lots of hard work from the whole team. But we shouldn’t underplay the importance of culture in creating the place that this hard work happens.\nFor sure, culture is conceptual. But, there are many indicators that culture is absolutely tangible. Nothing happens by chance. It needs intentional nurturing and persistent attention to make sure it is ‘the way we do things around here’ – everyday.\nDr Simon Camby\nChief Education Officer\nCognita Global Group","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/blog/culture-its-intentional/"}

Whilst the past twelve months have certainly posed many challenges, never have we been prouder of the resilience, independence and creativeness shown by our children.\nThere has been a step change in the world of learning, undoubtedly accelerated by the pandemic, and a digital revolution is transforming our classrooms, bringing together technology and traditional methods like never before. The smooth transition between the classroom and online learning has become essential and a hybrid learning experience is unlocking endless opportunities for our students to develop the skills they will need beyond school.\nIn preparation for their digital future, we have developed a comprehensive digital learning programme for our students which integrates the most beneficial aspects of digital education into our high-quality provision. All students in Year 3 and above are equipped with their own personal learning device for use both at school and home, which enables not only a seamless switch between class based and virtual learning, but also allows our teachers to use technology in the best way possible to support personalised learning; from providing feedback through to developing peer-to-peer collaboration skills. Whilst they will not replace traditional classroom teaching, these devices have the power to enhance the outstanding teaching and learning at Breaside and both students and teachers are benefitting from the technology that supports our children’s learning.\nThe value that hybrid learning brings to Breaside is incalculable; it reimagines the way that our students learn, blending the best of traditional classroom methods with EdTech that enriches digital literacy, strengthening our fundamental tailored approach to learning. At Breaside, we are proud to be a forward-thinking school with traditional values at our heart.","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/blog/traditional-values-at-our-heart/"}

We actively encourage risk taking and prepare the children for the future through a broad spectrum of experiences both in and out of the classroom. Residential trips this year so far have taken the children ‘off grid’ at Bushcraft, swinging through the high ropes at PGL in Osmington Bay and to a chateau in Normandy to immerse themselves in French culture.

If you’re not really sure where to start, we have got some tips that might help. \nFind the root of the issue\nNow, this is much easier said than done. It is unlikely to be as easy as asking your son or daughter about why they don’t like going to school and them giving an honest answer the first time. Try and have open conversations and discuss the things they do like about school and then move on to why they don’t want to go.\nIf the answer is because they don’t like getting up in the morning, the solution could be as simple as a different bedtime/morning routine, but if the answer is rooted in bigger issues such as finding the work too hard, disliking their teacher or even bullying then that is when you will need to take more action. \nPastoral care\nOnce you have got a better idea of what the root of the issue is you can then start to tackle it. If the school that your child attends has a good pastoral care policy, it may be beneficial to involve them in the process so that you have a contact at the school that can support both you and your child. \nPositive reinforcement\nWhen working through the process of trying to make changes, follow up each success with positive reinforcement, assuring your child that they are doing well and you are pleased with their behaviour. \nEncourage participation in extracurricular activities\nWhen a child doesn’t feel positive about attending school, the idea of spending more time there by participating in after school activities or at lunchtime can be a difficult sell, however, discovering a hidden passion could be the ticket to a happy school life. Attending a new club might also help them meet and make new friends which can also be a big contributing factor to a child’s happiness by providing them with a new social circle.\nThese are just some of the ways that we advise at Breaside Preparatory School to help your son or daughter to enjoy school again. We are passionate about creating an environment in which all children can feel secure, inspired and most importantly, happy. We strive to support any child that is anything less than happy and excited about coming to school each day. \nIf you would like to learn more about our school you can either request a prospectus here or better still, register to attend an open day so that you are able to experience the school in person.","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/blog/how-do-i-help-my-child-to-love-school/"}

Following lunch the children had some more time to explore and learn about the beach and sea before we starting to board our coaches for the journey home.\nThe children had a wonderful day and it was so lovely to see them playing in the sand with their friends whilst also giving something back to the local community in the form of a beach clean.\nThe best Global Be Well Day yet we believe!

With Year 5 going underground, taking to the sky and making memories on the high seas.\nThe morning dawned bright and sunny and after another huge breakfast the groups made their way to the first activities of the day. It was Group 3 who tackled the infamous giant swing, with even Miss Golds and Mrs Clarke soaring to new heights.\nGroups 1 and 2 climbed to the top of the climbing wall and went underground to explore the tunnels of Osmington Bay. It was especially good to see everyone taking part in all the activities overcoming initial nerves.\nGroups 3 and 4 enjoyed their chance to discover orienteering with Group 4 also learning some exciting survival skills such as starting fires and building camps.\nThis afternoon all of Year 5 went to Weymouth to reenact the victories of London 2012 by taking to the seas. Groups 3 and 4 went sailing whilst groups 1 and 2 built their own rafts and then took to the sea to test them out. Special mention must be given to Ali in 5J who didn’t want to leave the water and clearly got a lot out of the experience.\nTonight we have dressed up and got ready for another highlight of the trip the disco. We are all hitting the dance floor to show our best moves and that is just the staff!\nWe now only have a short time left at Osmington Bay and it is lovely to see all the children getting on so well with each other and definitely developing positively from the experience.\nPublished on: 18th May 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-5-trip-osmington-bay-2-2-3-2/"}

Special must be given to Miss Golds for completing her own zip wire flight.\nGroups 3 and 4 perfected their climbing skills on the many climbing walls at Osmington Bay. They also completed one of PGLs brand new obstacle courses calle the ‘Sensory Trail’.\nWe have just enjoyed a delicious dinner with many of the children asking for seconds as it was so tasty. We are now participating in a PGL tradition, their famous campfire. This includes traditional campfire songs and activities.\nWe will be off for an early night as tomorrow we will all be going off site to enjoy some sailing and raft building at the amazing Weymouth water sports centre which was a London 2012 Olympic venue.\nPublished on: 17th May 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-5-trip-osmington-bay-2-2-3/"}

Molly, our PGL rep, took us for a delicious breakfast before we split into our four groups for an action packed day of activities.\nSome of us started the day with ‘Survivor’ learning essential skills for surviving in the wild such as shelter building and starting a fire. We also visited the beach for some beach combing and beach racing. Miss Golds reclaimed her crown as the PGL pebble building champion 2017!\nThe rest of us took part in some exciting problem solving exercises where we demonstrated excellent teamwork and logical thinking skills. Before we knew it lunchtime had arrived.\nAfter another filling meal groups one and two got ready for an afternoon of sailing in Weymouth harbour. Groups three and four prepared to face the underground tunnels and dizzying heights of the abseiling tower!\nThe sailing was truly a highlight of the week so far for some of the children, with Roger in 5G being so excited to be trying something he had wanted to do for many years and will now investigate taking up sailing back at home. Mr Jackson and Mr Jefferies enjoyed taking to the water too.\nMeanwhile at the top of the abseiling tower everyone in groups three and four completed the terrifying walk down the tower. Special mention must be given to Aarya who overcame a fear of heights to complete the abseil commenting bravely at the end “can I go again!”\nThis evening we are playing the game ‘Capture the Flag’ with Molly before we all getting a good night sleep so we can continue the fun tomorrow.\nPublished on: 16th May 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-5-trip-osmington-bay-2-2/"}

Before heading to the PGL site our wonderful coach driver Phil dropped us off at the beach in Weymouth, some of us enjoyed football with Mr Brindley whilst others built sandcastles. All of us enjoyed a traditional ’99’ ice cream with a big flake in the top.\nWe have now all arrived safely at PGL Osmington Bay where we were met by our enthusiastic PGL rep called Molly. We quickly found our rooms and after a short break we set off to find the dining room, the food looks great and I’m sure we are not going to be hungry during our stay.\nAfter dinner we have our first activity called ‘Cluedo’ which will be run by Molly and then we are off for an early night before we start our activities early tomorrow morning.\nPublished on: 15th May 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-5-trip-osmington-bay-2/"}

Luckily they had lots of time before breakfast to pack their bags and tidy their rooms.\nDue on court at 1030, our netballers went through their warm up drills and tactical meetings with Mrs Fletcher and Miss O’Toole. Wet conditions were going to make it difficult but our girls were excited for the 2 games ahead. Breaside2 team got a convincing win – Mahika was excellent at WA and all the girls combined well. They had been playing well all weekend and a win on the board was the least they deserved. Breaside1 had very tough 1st game of the day against Cheltenham Ladies College. Leah kept the opposing centre at bay, Shaan got a crucial opening goal, Cara wing attacked like Wonderwoman. An incredibly close match ended 3-2 to Cheltenham Ladies. Breaside played incredibly and we are very very proud of them.\nSadly the tournament ended for both of our teams at the group stage, but this did mean they had time to meet Eboni Beckford-Chambers. The Bath and England defender kindly gave up her time to speak to the girls, sign autographs and pose for selfies. She was very encouraging and gave the girls great advice.\nSuddenly it was time to leave. Breaside packed their souvenirs, visited the vending machines one last time and climbed aboard the coach home.\nThis weekend has been amazing. Miss O’Toole has worked so hard to organise everything – a huge thank you to her. congratulations must also go to Mrs Fletcher. Under her stewardship the standard of netball has reached an incredibly high level: proven by taking a group of Year 6s to a Year 7 tournament and showing they deserve to be there on merit.\nWe hope the girls have enjoyed themselves and will take away happy memories of their weekend. As they move off to new schools in September and join new netball teams, they will always be a part of the Breaside Netball Tour 2017 team\n. \nPublished on: 12th March 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-6-french-trip-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"}

Mahika lead the charge with a 5:00am start with Kavika following closely behind; the teachers happily entertained them in the corridor before going to breakfast.\nThe day’s plan was to “queue and do” in the morning and then start our netball tournament in the afternoon. With a sprint down to the harness area, the girls split off into their chosen activities. Ruby, Cordelia and Kavika mastered the zip wire. Amie swung from the trapeze and all the girls demonstrated their netballing prowess on the aeroball (trampolining cages with netballs!) By the end of the session, we’d split into an archery and giant swing group with Isabel and Bella right on target and the others letting everyone on site know they were enjoying the high adrenaline rush on the giant swing (i.e. screaming as they were dropped from height).\nWe filled up with a nutritious lunch and then donned our brand new netball dresses (not Mr Duke), ready to roll at part one of the netball tournament. Organisers commented on their smart attire and said how professional they all looked. The tournament began and both teams quickly established themselves as worthy participants in a Year 7 tournament despite being far younger than everyone else. Super shooting by Jasmine and Shaan, awesome defending from Breaside2 defenders, Lena, Isabel and Kavika and amazing link-up play by Leah, Lainah and Bella. Breaside were in their element! The two sides played their socks off and the professional umpires commented on how polite, well-behaved and skillful our Breaside players were. Miss O’Toole and Mrs Fletcher stood proudly and watched eagerly from the sidelines. The girls had a great time and did themselves proud on the court; 4 matches for each team flew by with great exertion and enjoyment. 2 more games would follow on Sunday.\nIn the evening, our 19 tired girls were signed up to play a game of ambush – a mass game of hide and seek in the woods. Finally, we retired to bed and settled very early, eager to continue the netball tournament tomorrow.\nThe children proved themselves to not only be exceptionally well behaved, but also highly skilled netball players. We, the teachers, are very proud of our girls.\nPublished on: 12th March 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-6-french-trip-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"}

Liddington was the destination: an opportunity to compete against other schools as well as have a go at familiar PGL activities.\nSteve the bus driver delivered us safely and early so we had an hour to fill before dinner time. The girls tested out the courts in two quick games of 5 on 5 and a shooting drill. A tense game of knockout shooting started badly as Mrs Fletcher and Mr Duke were both knocked out early. Slowly the girls whittled themselves down to a final between Jasmine and Leah, with Miss Pryce coming out on top. The standard was very high and our sharpshooters are looking very good for tomorrow’s first round matches.\nA nourishing dinner set the girls up nicely for the evening’s activity; a series of challenges around the site including netball shooting, a 2 on 2 game and a quiz. Despite not winning the girls enjoyed the run around and were ready for bed soon after.\nThe day’s excursion and excitement has caught up with the girls and they are safely in bed. Tomorrow’s day will start with some ‘queue and do’ activities and then Breaside kicks off their tournament in the afternoon.\nThank you to everyone following along at www.twitter.com/breasidenetball We are looking forward to posting more pictures and news tomorrow.\nPublished on: 10th March 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-6-french-trip-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2/"}

Lessons are either provided by staff from Bromley Youth Music Trust (known as BYMT) or by self-employed visiting music teachers.\nWhat can students learn? \nWe are currently able to offer individual lessons to pupils who are in Years 1-6 on the following instruments: \nStrings: Violin, Viola, Cello\nWoodwind: Flute, Saxophone, Clarinet, Recorder\nFife, Toot, J-Sax, Dood are smaller versions of wind instruments that may be more suitable for beginners, and the teacher will advise.\nBrass: Trumpet, Cornet, Trombone, Baritone\nOther: Drum kit, Singing, Guitar, Piano\nWhen and where will they have the lessons? \nLessons take place during the school day. Pupils come out of lessons to attend, but the timetable is worked out on a rotation basis so they do not miss the same lesson each week.\nHow much do lessons cost? \n£200 per term for individual 30 minute lessons\n£133 per term for individual 20 minute lessons\n£100 per term for individual 15 minute lessons\nHow do I pay? \nOnce we have received your application/agreement forms, we will pass your details to one of our teachers and you will receive an invoice and other information from them.\nAre there any instrumental/vocal lessons you would particularly recommend? \nAll are as worthwhile as each other, but do bear in mind that orchestral instruments such as violin, cello, flute etc are ideal first instruments that can play together in ensembles, and so your child will be able to make music with their friends more quickly. For any instrument the most important thing is that your child attends lessons regularly and practises during the week. Just ten minutes a day can make all the difference to progress! \nWhat do I do about obtaining an instrument? \nIf you are applying for piano lessons you will need a piano at home. Some children do start by learning on an electric keyboard, but this is quite a different instrument and progress in the long term will be hampered. If you decide to buy/hire an instrument please seek advice before doing so. We recommend hiring from the Music Hub at BYMT or Saunders Music. Please visit their websites for further information: BYMT https://musichubsales.org.uk 07768 312270 and Saunders Music http://www.saundersmusic.co.uk 01732 740755\nWe are also in the process of buying some high quality smaller sized melody instruments for beginners that you can rent from school. Please contact Mrs Eastwood for details.\nHow do I apply for music lessons? \nSimply fill in the online form below and return it to Mrs Eastwood at chrissy.eastwood@breaside.co.uk\nWhen do lessons start? \nThe first set of 10 (out of 30) lessons commence in September. It is possible to apply for lessons at any point in the school year, however we often have a waiting list therefore children may have to wait until a slot becomes available.\nWhat happens if we want to stop music lessons? \nYou need to email/write to Mrs Eastwood and the instrumental teacher by half term. Lessons can only stop at the end of a set of 10 – not part way through.\nWill learning an instrument help my child’s education? \nYes, we believe so. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that children learning an instrument not only improve their social and practical skills, but their progress and achievement in other subjects increases as they develop their listening, comprehension and reading skills.\nIf you wish to proceed with an application then please fill in this online form – https://forms.office.com/e/ENtjM2uTuY","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/school-life/extra-curricular/"}

If, for any reason, we ever need to return to this way of learning, we’re ideally placed to support our pupils through those challenging times.\nDuring full-time online learning, our provisions meant that we could continue to provide a high-quality education experience. We also recognised that learning from home will not always be straightforward, with multiple family members needing to work and study simultaneously in the same space.\nThe programme we devised was based on our current curriculum with vital feedback from existing parents. Supported by both live (synchronous) and pre-prepared (asynchronous) lessons and resources, our online learning offers a blend of different teaching methods and gives families the flexibility they need during changing times, as well as ensuring we were able to maintain our pupils’ academic progress.\nTechnology and platforms\nTechnology has become a fundamental part of our education, not only allowing us to deliver great teaching and learning but as a platform for collaboration and productivity. We have witnessed first-hand the positive impact it can have, putting students at the heart of their learning by increasing engagement, developing intrinsic interpersonal skills, and preparing them for the future of adult life.\nWe use a variety of platforms and resources to support the learning and educational experience of our children. These platforms include:\nSeesaw\nMicrosoft Teams\n1-to-1 Devices\nWe have also taken the next step in our digital learning journey by providing every student in Years 3, 4, 5 and 6 with a laptop.\nWe believe that 1-to-1 devices are powerful tools that augment and transform the learning experience while offering the best possible resilience against any disruption to students’ educations. They will be used in balance with other teaching methodologies and woven into lessons in a planned and meaningful way to support the learning outcomes.\nThe key benefits of 1-to-1 devices are:\nGreater control over how students use and work with the resources provided\nNew opportunities for teachers to deliver different types of instructions or resources depending on what works best for your child\nMore immediate – and different types of – feedback on work\nPresenting work in new ways and maintaining a digital portfolio\nReal-time collaboration between pupils – and even working with students at other schools in other countries across the Cognita family\nWe have put together a handy guide to our new 1-to-1 device programme featuring further information on the devices, their benefits and the safety protocols and software we have put in place. Download it below:\nWellbeing and character development\nAs well as supporting academic success, we prioritise the emotional wellbeing of our pupils and their families.\nBy providing access to a range of resources, making wellbeing checks for pupils at home and ensuring that our online provision is flexible enough to fit with family life, we cater for all aspects of a child’s education.","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/online-learning/"}

Playing with one key player down (Super Lainah!) due to injury and knowledge that this game stood between them and the League title, the girls lined up for centre pass.\nThe game began with some excellent attacking play, superb shooting and Breaside taking the lead with two goals to nil. However, West Lodge then played some superb netball scoring 3 goals in quick succession. We went to half time feeling hopeful but knowing we had a very hard second half to follow. The score at half time was 5-3 to Breaside.\nWith the amazing parent and teacher supporters cheering them on, the girls began the second half in determined fashion. Amie Lawrence defended brilliantly in the circle denying a strong GA from scoring too often and Leah Pryce played her best game of the season, working athletically at Centre. Jasmine performed some outstanding interceptions and shots, keeping a cool head at all times. When the full time whistle blew and extra-time was awarded due to a technicality, the girls responded in the most impressive way! Continuing to keep their cool, defend brilliantly and facilitate Jasmine scoring the ‘golden goal’. A hugely tense, nail-biter of a final, resulting in a final scoreline of Breaside 7, West Lodge 6.\nWELL DONE GIRLS!

This will create a green legacy of its own, with every tree planted bringing benefits for people, wildlife and climate, now and for the future.\nHere at Breaside to commemorate the Queen’s Jubilee our School Council and Year 6 Prefects planted a tree near 4S’ classroom.

We started the term by planting some small saplings, from the Woodland Trust, that will eventually grow into bigger trees. The trees are part of our project for the Queens Platinum Jubilee. The Queen asked us to plant a tree rather than buy her a present. The children will be able to watch the trees grow as they grow too.\nDuring Forest School sessions we have made leaf and mud pictures, looked closely at natural materials inside a hoop, collected rainwater from the trees and stamped in the muddy puddles. We have also done some bird watching, made apple bird feeders to hang in the trees and looked at some abandoned bird and wasps’ nests. The children then made their own nests using natural materials we found at Forest School.\nOne of our most favourite things to do at Forest School is to dig in the mud, make mud pies and look for bugs with the magnifying glasses.\nRecently we have been looking for signs of Spring. We watched the buds on the tree change into leaves over the past weeks and have closely observed the Daffodils, Snowdrops and Forget Me Nots at Forest School. Then we spotted some beautiful white and yellow blossom on the trees.\nRoger Rabbit frequently visits us, with his Forest School friends too. We have noticed that a cheeky Robin often pops into Forest School, we think he is looking for the crumbs from our snack!\nPublished on: 7th April 2022","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/forest-school/"}

It can be easy to talk about but hard to pin down. Culture is often seen as:\nThe way we do things around here\nToday, I was at Breaside Preparatory School in Bromley, UK. I first visited Breaside in 2015 and, for me, it is always a special place. Why? There are many reasons, but one is the culture of the school. The culture is is displayed through so many observable signs.\nI always stand with the leadership team on the school gate as children and parents enter. Without exception, every child says, ‘good morning’ and engages with the school’s leaders. Sometimes a few words, sometimes a full conversation; but always a meaningful connection.\nI notice that children look out for each other. They show genuine care and encouragement for their classmates. They ‘wrap an arm around’, sometimes physically and sometimes metaphorically. This isn’t for show, it is just the way it is.\nI observe the quality of work displayed around the school is always high quality and honours children’s effort and progress.\nI could go on as there are many more. These all point to something important, detail matters. It matters because these contribute to the school’s culture.\nThis is a school that deeply values academic outcomes, that offers a genuinely holistic education and embeds a culture of wellbeing. This is all wrapped in intentional care – care for each other, care for our relationships and care for learning.\nOur Cognita Framework includes a strategic pillar identifying the importance of leadership in every school. One of our contributors to leadership is ‘A culture that has been intentionally created and managed through trust and empowerment’. We use the word ‘contributor’ because we see that culture ‘contributes to’ the student experience and outcomes.\nBreaside shows how the culture is intentionally managed and nothing is left to chance. It is a school that achieves great outcomes for each child. For sure, this is a result of lots of hard work from the whole team. But we shouldn’t underplay the importance of culture in creating the place that this hard work happens.\nFor sure, culture is conceptual. But, there are many indicators that culture is absolutely tangible. Nothing happens by chance. It needs intentional nurturing and persistent attention to make sure it is ‘the way we do things around here’ – everyday.\n[BTW – it was World Book Day and I met three Paddington Bears coming up the stairs!]\nDr Simon Camby\nChief Education Officer\nCognita Global Group \nPublished on: 2nd March 2023","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/14996-2/"}

This means adopting a personalised approach towards providing exciting opportunities both inside and outside the classroom in which all our children can excel and thrive.\nBreaside’s aim is to deliver challenge to all children so that they reach their full potential. Alongside this, we are keen to ensure that our most able, gifted and talented children are formally identified then supported and nurtured further through our broad curriculum and wide range of extra-curricular activities.\nAt Breaside, we work hard to support children gifted and talented in English, Maths, Science, Technology, the Arts and Sport. In addition to differentiated classroom activities, this includes additional challenge days and workshops as well as taking part in national and regional competitions. Additionally, Breaside has links with many local schools and external agencies, ensuring that children are presented with a wealth of opportunities to explore and develop their skills and talents. Recent collaborations have included Maths problem solving contests, computer coding masterclasses and a Breaside Bake Off. Within school, children have the opportunity to develop their leadership and collaboration skills through School Council, the school prefect and ambassador system and regular performances and productions.\nBreaside work closely with NACE (National Association for Able Children in Education) which nationally recognises and celebrates those schools which provide the very highest level of challenge for its pupils. NACE helps teachers provide excellent teaching and learning for able, gifted and talented pupils. As of June 2018, NACE has named Breaside the first school in Bromley to be accredited with the NACE Challenge Award meaning that we are now placed in a select group of just 1.6% of schools across the UK who have achieved this prestigious Challenge Award.\nThe recognition of this award to Breaside Preparatory School is a significant achievement.

The award is given in recognition of school-wide commitment to high-quality provision for more able learners, within the context of challenge for all.\nNACE CEO Rob Lightfoot said: “Breaside Preparatory School has worked hard to attain reaccreditation through the NACE Challenge Award. It has displayed a continued commitment to develop an environment in which all learners are challenged and supported to be the best they can be.” \nThe award is based on the NACE Challenge Framework, which sets out criteria for high-quality provision for more able learners within a wider ethos of challenge for all. The framework is available as part of the NACE Challenge Development Programme – a suite of resources developed by NACE to help schools evaluate and improve their provision for more able learners. \nNACE’s assessor reported: “The school has a clear commitment to high achievement for all, driven by strong school leadership and a dedicated staff. Lessons are challenging, utilising careful planning and an in-depth knowledge of pupils’ achievements and readiness for learning. … Pupils have a high degree of knowledge and skills [and] can make links in their learning and draw from prior experience. Pupils are proficient in using the oracy skills modelled by teachers … They understand the benefits of working with others and … sharing a wide range of viewpoints. They are articulate and confident when speaking to each other, presenting ideas or responding to questions. … \n“Pupils have many opportunities to learn and develop skills in both traditional academic areas and more widely … With pupils commenting on the importance of activities … from which they have grown in confidence and independence.” \nImproving provision for the more able remains a priority for many schools and has been highlighted by Estyn as a key focus. The experience and evidence gathered by Challenge Award-accredited schools also shows that effective strategies to improve provision for the more able are likely to have a positive impact on the achievement of a much wider group of learners. \nTo attain the Challenge Award, schools must complete a detailed self-evaluation using the NACE Challenge Framework, submit a portfolio of supporting evidence, and undertake assessment by a NACE associate. The assessment process includes examination of school data and key documents; lesson observations; and interviews with school leaders, learners, parents and governors. \nCEO Rob Lightfoot said, “The Challenge Award is presented in recognition of whole-school commitment to and achievement in providing effective challenge and support for all – spanning school leadership, curriculum, teaching and learning, processes for identification and tracking, extracurricular opportunities, strong communication and partnerships, and ongoing evaluation.” \nBreaside Preparatory School will now remain part of the international community of Challenge Award-accredited schools which have demonstrated a sustained and effective commitment to meeting the needs of more able learners, and an interest in sharing expertise for the wider benefit of the education community. \nFind out more: www.nace.co.uk/challenge\nMiss H Bodycombe\nMore Able & Talented Co-Ordinator\nPublished on: 13th March 2023","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/breaside-preparatory-school-celebrates-nace-challenge-award-second-accreditation/"}

This is the second year that this programme has been commended, with the ongoing feedback received from parents directly inputting into the continuous improvement in schools such as Breaside. \nThe judges applauded Cognita’s use of parent feedback to take real action and make decisions to provide a better student experience. The high response rate was said to show an excellent level of parental engagement, with the focus on culture change demonstrating a long-term evolution of schools in the group. \n‘Voice of the Parent’ was rolled out in all Cognita schools within three geographical regions (Asia, Europe and South America), enabling schools across the group to understand and act upon parents’ authentic views and experiences.\n“We’re delighted to honour Cognita as a 2017 Confirmit ACE Award winner for their innovation and excellence in their Voice of the Parent programme,” said Ken Østreng, President and CEO of Confirmit. “Cognita continues to show their commitment to listening to their customers to better understand their needs, drive business change and deliver an exceptional experience.”\nThe success of the Voice of the Parent programme has led to Cognita launching a dedicated Voice of the Employee (VoE) programme across all schools and regional offices. This commitment to expanding the programme to include employees, as well as parents, was said to create a more holistic view by the ACE Awards judges, and is now being followed by a pilot Voice of the Student programme, focusing on gathering pupil feedback regarding wellbeing and teaching. \nFor further information about Cognita, please visit www.cognitaschools.com. \nPublished on: 1st September 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/8300-2/"}

Firstly, we watched a short film in the cinema and then we made our way into the Great Hall. It was amazing! My favourite part was the scale model of Hogwarts Castle. Did you know it was built to a 1:24 scale? It was a great day and I really enjoyed myself!” By Alanna 5G\n“Yesterday, we visited the Harry Potter Studios in Watford, North London.

Visiting Breaside is always a pleasure as the children and staff offer such a warm and thoughtful welcome.\nThis week, I met with children from Years 1, 3 and 5 in addition to meeting the new Head Boys and Head Girls (pictured). Talking with pupils is always insightful as they are the true test of how effective any school is. The children told me how much they enjoy coming to school and how they enjoy their learning. In particular, the children can explain how their learning is challenging and why it is good to have this level of challenge. The older pupils were keen to explain how it feels to struggle with your learning and also to fail sometimes as an opportunity to use feedback and become a better learner. For me, this demonstrated a high degree of self-reflection. There is much work in education about the need to develop ‘metacognition’ in all students, this is the ability to be both self-reflective but also the ability to self-regulate. This feedback from Breaside pupils showed me that the pupils are indeed developing their metacognitive skills.\nI wish all children and staff every success for the academic year.\nWith best wishes\nSimon Camby, Director of Education, Cognita Schools\nPublished on: 29th September 2017","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/simon-camby-meets-breaside-head-boys-girls/"}

All the boys were excited and raring to play. This was the first time we had played under the lights and this seemed to inspire our players.\nFrom the start we played with aggression and put them under pressure. The boys were all focused and were making correct decisions out on the field. The tackling was ferocious and we were moving the ball very well. Ball placement and rucking was outstanding. Some fantastic tries by Ebube, Cameron, Aku and Miika and were 6 – 3 up by half time. In the second half I could see the boys were loving their afternoon and wanted to keep pushing themselves to improve. In the 2nd half we extended our lead with a superb try by Matthew who dodged and weaved his way past 5 defenders to score a diving try in the corner. All the boys played out of their skins and were truly exceptional. We won the game 10 – 6.\nThe Director of Sport of Trinity said to me after the game that they were the best U11 team he had ever seen! The boys and the parents should be very proud of themselves. A big thank you to all the parents who came to support and I think the big highlight was the lovely tea and coffee with the bacon and 2 hash browns in a bap after the game.\n“It was a great game, boys all seemed to really enjoy it too. All played so well!”\nMr Evans.\nPublished on: 17th November 2019","url":"https://www.breaside.co.uk/year-6-rugby-vs-trinity/"}
